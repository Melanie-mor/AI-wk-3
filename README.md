Week3 AI Assignment
‚úÖ Q1: TensorFlow vs. PyTorch
TensorFlow: Graph-based execution; great for production/deployment (e.g., with TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js).
PyTorch: Dynamic computation graph (eager execution); more intuitive for research and experimentation.
Use Case Example:
Choose PyTorch when you need flexibility and quick debugging.
Choose TensorFlow for scalable models with deployment needs.

‚úÖ Q2: Jupyter Notebook Use Cases
Interactive Prototyping: Great for step-by-step testing and visualizations.
Documentation & Teaching: Combines code, markdown, and plots for explainable workflows.

‚úÖ Q3: spaCy for NLP
Enhances NLP by:
Pretrained pipelines for NER, POS, Dependency Parsing.
Efficient tokenization vs. basic .split() or regex.
Fast & production-ready, compared to slower, less accurate string-based methods.
