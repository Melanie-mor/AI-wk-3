# ðŸŒ¾ AI Project for SDG 2: Zero Hunger

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates how classical machine learning, deep learning, and NLP tools can support SDG 2 by predicting crop yields, analyzing handwritten digits for accessibility, and extracting insights from product reviews related to food and nutrition.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Sections
1. **Iris Dataset â€“ Scikit-learn**
   - Decision Tree classifier for crop prediction
   - Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores

2. **MNIST Dataset â€“ TensorFlow**
   - CNN model to classify handwritten digits
   - Achieved >95% test accuracy
   - Sample predictions visualized

3. **Amazon Reviews â€“ spaCy**
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Rule-based sentiment analysis on food product reviews

## ðŸ§  Ethical Reflection
- Explored bias in sentiment classification and model interpretation
- Discussed fairness risks in rule-based vs. pretrained pipelines

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- spaCy
- matplotlib, seaborn
